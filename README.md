# Commonwealth_Games_Analysis
### Project on R Shiny. Dashboard to analyze and predict commonwealth games.
This application provides visualisations on data on the Commonwealth Games, the international sporting event held every four years between members of the Commonwealth of Nations .

## Project: Commonwealth game analysis
## Project Problem Statement:
One of the expanding areas necessitating good predictive accuracy is sport
prediction, due to the large monetary amounts involved in betting. In addition,
coaches and team owners are striving for models so that they can understand and
formulate strategies needed to win. The aim of this project is to develop models for
predicting the number of medals won by each country at the commonwealth games
2022 using information that was available prior to the Games.
This dashboard has been designed to analyze and visualize the performance of
different countries during the past years and illustrate a predictive model to predict
the performance of a country in the future.
There are two main categories of prediction methods: one is predictions based on
competition results leading up to the commonwealth, the other is by using economics
and a range of factors to base their predictions (or a mixture of both of these).

### ABOUT US
#### We are the 'Kuttans Te Kudiyan'
'Kuttans Te Kudiyan' is derived from two languages, in which 'Kuttan' is taken from Malayalam meaning 'boy' and 'Kudiyan' is taken from Punjabi meaning 'girls'. Five Kuttans from Kerela and two Kudiyan from North India, together formed this group. We are M.Sc. BDA students from St. Joseph's College(Autonomous), Bangalore. The initial thought in mind was to prepare an easily accessible user-interface on 'Commonwealth Games Analysis'. Our motive while working on this project was to build a model to predict the medal tally for 2022 CWG which will be useful for sports betting companies to set the odds in advance, while sponsors and media companies can direct their resources to promising teams. We are trying to publish a research paper based on the findings we made through this project. We would really like to know your views on this.
